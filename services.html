    <h5>2020 chevrolet Corvette StingrayCHEVROLET</h5>
    <p>2020 chevrolet Corvette,Though there is an assortment of brand-new and fully redesigned passenger cars hitting the road for 2020 model year,
        <br> their numbers are dwindling as buyers are instead choosing sport-utility vehicles as their rides of choice. 
        <br> Stalwart sedans like the Chevrolet Impala and Ford Taurus are being discontinued, with the number of small cars in particular thinning rapidly.
         <br> While there were 26 subcompact models on the market as recently as 2016, they’re down to just 17 for 2019, 
        <br> with the Ford Fiesta and Chevrolet Sonic reportedly bowing out at the end of the current model year.
        <br> Here’s a look at some of the most prominent introductions reaching dealers’ showrooms for 2020

        <h5>2020 Cadillac CT4-V</h5>
        <p align="justify"> Cadillac introduces a new compact luxury sedan for 2020, the CT4. 
            <br> Adorned with uncluttered styling, it fills the slot in the lineup that was vacated when the ATS was discontinued. 
            <br> Few details on the base model are available as of this writing, but we do know it will be rear drive with all-wheel-drive available, 
            <br> and come powered by a turbocharged four-cylinder engine with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Cadillac has, however, released preliminary information on the sporty CT4-V model, 
            <br> which will feature a 2.7-liter turbocharged engine with an estimated 320 horsepower, a near perfect 50/50 front to rear weight ratio, grippy Brembo brakes, and precise handling abilities.
            <br> Available features include Cadillac’s semi-autonomous Super Cruise system that allows hands-free highway driving.

        <h5>2020 Cadillac CT5</h5>
        <p align="justify"> The Cadillac CT5 replaces the midsize CTS for 2020, and is dynamically styled with a broad grille, 
            <br> narrow LED headlamps and a sleek fastback roofline. The CT5 comes powered by either a turbocharged 
            <br> 2.0-liter 237-horsepower four-cylinder engine or a livelier 335-horsepower twin-turbo 3.0-liter V6,
            <br> each with specific exhaust-note tuning. Both drive the rear wheels via a 10-speed automatic transmission, 
            <br> with all-wheel drive optional. 
            <br> There’s also a high-performance CT5-V variant with a 355 horsepower version of the V6 and performance-minded upgrades. 
            <br> Most of the latest accident avoidance features are available, as is a rear-camera mirror, massaging front seats, and 
            <br> Caddy’s Super Cruise system.

        <h5>2020 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500</h5>
        <p align="justify"> The 2020 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 takes the original “pony car” to new levels of performance to keep up with the likes of 
            the Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 and the Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat. A hand-built supercharged 5.2-liter V8 engine channels a 
            whopping 760 horsepower and 625 pound-feet of torque through the rear wheels via a seven-speed dual clutch automatic transmission. 
            Ford says it can make the sprint to 60 mph in less than three seconds. There’s also suspension and steering upgrades, along with 
            what Ford calls the largest front brake rotors ever available on an American sports coupe to help rein in all those raging horses. 
            You’ll have to leave the kids at home, however, as the GT500 deletes the back seat to save weight.

        <h5>2020 McLaren GTMCLAREN</h5>
        <p align="justify"> Supercar maker McLaren debuts its first grand touring car for 2020, the appropriately named GT. A grand tourer is traditionally 
            a more accommodating alternative to a flat out sports car that can be used as a daily driver or taken on extended road trips 
            comfortably. The GT rides on a carbon fiber structure and its super sleek bodywork is comprised of aluminum panels, both for 
            the sake of weight reduction. Its interior is both posh and driver focused, and a wealth of features includes a sophisticated 
            infotainment system. A 4.0-liter V8 engine generates a lusty 612 horsepower with 465 pound-feet of launch happy torque. 
            The automaker says it will reach 60 mph in a quick 3.1 seconds with a top speed of 203 mph. A new Proactive Damping Control 
            suspension promises a smooth ride, while maintaining the appropriate McLaren levels of driving dynamics.

        <h5>2020 Mini Cooper SE  MINI / BMW AG</h5>
        <p align="justify">Mini is launching a new full-electric Cooper SE coupe for 2020 that combines the brand’s famed go-kart-like handling with zero-emissions operation. 
            <br> It promises lively acceleration with its electric motor producing 181 horsepower with 199 pound-feet of torque. 
            <br> Expect a 0-60 mph time at 7.3 seconds. The Cooper SE features four driving modes and two regenerative braking selections, 
            <br> with the ability to engage one-pedal driving. Its official U.S.-spec operating range has not yet been established, 
            <br> but it’s rated to run for 146-167 miles on the European test cycle.

        <h5>2020 Toyota GR Supra TOYOTA</h5>
        <p align="justify">Toyota brings back the Supra for 2020 after being absent from its U.S. lineup for 21 years, and it remains an eminently stylish and capable sports car.Sharing components with the BMW Z4 roadster, the two-seater’s bodywork is radically curvy, with a “double bubble” roof 
            and long and pronounced scoops along the sides. It packs a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder engine that channels 335 horsepower 
            and 365 pound-feet of torque to the rear wheels. Coming with an eight-speed automatic transmission, 
            the GR Supra is good for a 4.1-second 0-60 mph run. A sophisticated suspension, 
            active rear differential and a perfect 50:50 front-to-rear weight ratio combine for crisp cornering abilities.

        <h5>2020 Tesla Roadster TESLA</h5>
        <p align="justify">Barring any production delays, the full-electric Tesla Roadster is expected to return for model year 2020 and hit the ground running. It features a decidedly 
            <br> modernistic curvy profile and promises rocket-like performance. A lightweight glass roof panel stores in the car’s trunk. Tesla claims it will be the 
            <br> fastest car on the planet, and one that can seat four at that. It’s said to make the leap to 60 mph in a sudden 1.9 seconds, with a highly illegal top 
            <br> speed of 250 mph. It’s operating range is claimed to be as much as 620 miles on a charge.
